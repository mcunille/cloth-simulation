# Mass Spring Cloth Simulation

This is a port of the final project for a Computer Graphics course at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey.

The original project was written using C++ on May 9th, 2015.

## Why

I loved this project and thought it would be fun to run it again. My goal is to translate the original C++ code into C# using [OpenTK](https://opentk.net/).

## Acknowledgments

Part of the code is a direct translation from abstractions written by Oriam De Gyves, who taught the class on Spring of 2015.
